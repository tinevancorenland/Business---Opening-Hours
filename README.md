# Business Opening Hours

## Objectives

- Learn how to use if statements and combine them 

## Instructions

- Create a simple html page
- Add some styling so it looks good
- Add two columns:
    - One column has a table containing the business hours of a company (just pick some random business hours)
    - The second column has a simple paragraph, containing a phrase declaring the business currently open / closed.
    
So basically:

- When you load the page:
    - Check the day
    - Check the time
    - Compare it to the business hours
    - Declare if the business is open

## BONUS Objective

- Add a live updating clock of the current time (digital)
- Add a button "Close early"
- When you click this button, the current day's business hours end at the current time in the table
(So on thursday if I click this button at 14:45, the table's business hours for thursday will change to end at 14:45)
